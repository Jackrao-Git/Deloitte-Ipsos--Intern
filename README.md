## The effect of population on house prices of 70 large-medium cities in China
In recent years, the trend of population growth has slowed down, and even began to show a negative growth momentum. In the context of China's rising concerns about "aging" and "population anxiety", the era of zero or even negative population growth is rapidly approaching. The likelihood of a labor crisis increases, with a smaller workforce meaning higher wages and slower economic growth.

Theoretically, a slowdown in population growth and a month-on-month decrease in the number of people will reduce the demand for real estate, thereby lowering housing prices. In fact, house prices have not been affected too much by the slowdown in population. It can be seen from the month-on-month data of house prices that house prices have shown a steady upward trend in recent years. Compared with the two factors of currency issuance and per capita income, population size is not a strong explanation for housing prices.

## Reasons:
1. People donâ€™t buy real estate exclusively for housing needs. Real estate is a popular asset, and many investors have chosen to purchase real estate in recent years. This makes some people buy property as an investment rather than a real home. Especially for people with more assets, the so-called "real estate speculation" concept has risen in recent years. Therefore, in addition to the rigid housing demand brought about by the population, investment behaviors unrelated to the population affect housing prices.
2. Due to the increasing housing prices, more and more younger generations cannot afford to buy a house. As a result, renting has become a popular choice. The first property of young people aged 25-34 is often to get married and buy a house, and the price elasticity of demand is small. And people aged 35-44 account for 24.5% of the total number of home buyers, and this group of people often belongs to the main body of housing investment. Those with real housing needs often cannot afford housing prices, so population numbers are not so relevant.
3. The housing prices in medium and large cities are increasing day by day, and young people who cannot afford housing pressure choose to go to second- or third-tier cities. With the development of transportation, people have more ability to radiate to the periphery of the city to seek lower housing prices. In relatively remote areas, housing prices are naturally lower. Therefore, in the era of constant or even negative population growth in medium and large cities, housing prices in 70 medium and large cities are still strong.


## The effect of money supply on house prices of 70 large-medium cities in China
During and after the 2008 global financial crisis, China issued half of the world's currency. Currency issuance has grown steadily in recent decades. The increase in the liquidity of money is accompanied by more money flowing into the bank, which reduces the pressure on the bank's funds, which reduces the bank's savings rate. Therefore, in a situation where loans are easier, the demand for properties will further increase.
Based on economic theory, when a commodity is in short supply, prices will rise. The rise in the money supply is accompanied by an increase in the demand for real estate investment. When the supply of property does not grow as fast as the demand for it, house prices rise. In addition, the investor's psychology is the consumer psychology of buying up and not buying down, and real estate developers dare not rush down the house price.

## Reasons:
1. The use of the geometric square method to complete the data makes the data more gentle than the reality, and the monthly forecast data growth is more linear, which cannot effectively reflect the special fiscal policy period, and the overall model tends to be stable. Considering the particularity of the money supply, its possibility of being affected by policies is not well represented in this dataset
2. Logically, currency issuance represents the goal of the central bank's monetary policy and is a major indicator of the central government's economic regulation. As a pillar industry of China's economy, real estate is bound to be affected by economic policies. As a result, both currency issuance and housing prices are subject to economic policy and trend adjustments.



## The impact of per capita income on house prices of 70 large-medium cities in China
The per capita income rises with the influence of currency issuance and inflation. Higher income brings more idle funds, and more funds drive the demand for real estate.
Due to the regulation of population policy, the slowdown in population growth makes less available labor force in the market, which leads to higher wages and therefore per capita income rises.

## Reasons:
1. The higher the per capita income, the more likely people are to invest to improve their living standards. Real estate is a good investment product, therefore, there should be a positive correlation between per capita income and housing price.
2. Rising housing prices can boost industrial output and drive economic growth. The rise of the real estate market has driven the production of upstream industries such as steel and cement. And stimulate the sales of furniture, building materials and other downstream industries. The rise in housing prices has increased the real income of workers in the real estate industry, and this series has boosted the disposable income of residents.
3. The rise in housing prices is an increase in their own assets for homeowners, thereby enhancing consumer confidence and expanding the propensity for marginal consumption. The rise in housing prices will enhance consumers' good expectations for the future and form a "confidence effect" of consumption. On the contrary, for consumers who do not have a house, rising rents and other aspects will increase the cost of buying a house and reduce consumption in other aspects, resulting in a "crowding-out effect" of consumption.
